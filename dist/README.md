## Issues
1. I had a really hard time getting the 'this' to work right with functions calling functions, but it turned out the easiest way to get it to work was to hand it as a parameter from the method on the prototype down each line to each function that needed it. Parameters, hurrah!
  - this was in the context of getting it to register as each person's turn, with the eventual goal that perhaps we could make the game 2 player, so that the hero and the villain both get to play in sequence
2. everybody had some really minor issues with git merging but managed to talk them out with each other since we decided to all come in saturday and work in the lab. Yay for actually being present and that helping!
